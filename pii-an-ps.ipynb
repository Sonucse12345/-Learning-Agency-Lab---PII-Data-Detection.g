thinking for innovation reflexion avril 2021 nathalie sylla challenge selection the tool i use to help all stakeholders finding their way through the complexity of a project is the mind map what exactly is a mind map according to the definition of buzan t and buzan b 1999 dessine moi l'intelligence paris les Ã©ditions d'organisation the mind map or heuristic diagram is a graphic representation technique that follows the natural functioning of the mind and allows the brain's potential to be released cf annex1 this tool has many advantages it is accessible to all and does not require significant material investment and can be done quickly it is scalable it allows categorization and linking of information it can be applied to any type of situation notetaking problem solving analysis creation of new ideas it is suitable for all people and is easy to learn it is fun and encourages exchanges it makes visible the dimension of projects opportunities interconnections it synthesizes it makes the project understandable it allows you to explore ideas the creation of a mind map starts with an ideaproblem located at its center this starting point generates ideaswork areas incremented around this center in a radial structure which in turn is completed with as many branches as new ideas this tool enables creativity and logic to be mobilized it is a map of the thoughts creativity is enhanced because participants feel comfortable with the method application insight i start the process of the mind map creation with the stakeholders standing around a large board white or paper board in the center of the board i write and highlight the topic to design through a series of questions i guide the stakeholders in modelling the mind map i adapt the series of questions according to the topic to be addressed in the type of questions we can use who what when where why how how much the use of the why is very interesting to understand the origin by this way the interviewed person frees itself from paradigms and thus dares to propose new ideas ways of functioning i plan two hours for a workshop design thinking for innovation reflexion avril 2021 nathalie sylla after modelling the mind map on paper i propose to the participants a digital visualization of their work with the addition of color codes images and interconnections this second workshop also lasts two hours and allows the mind map to evolve once familiarized with it the stakeholders discover the power of the tool then the second workshop brings out even more ideas and constructive exchanges between the stakeholders around this new mind map they have learned to work together and want to make visible the untold ideas i now present all the projects i manage in this type of format in order to ease rapid understanding for decision makers these presentations are the core of my business models the decision makers are thus able to identify the opportunities of the projects and can take quick decisions to validate them they find answers to their questions thank to a schematic representation approach what i find amazing with the facilitation of this type of workshop is the participants commitment for the project this tool helps to give meaning the participants appropriate the story and want to keep writing it then they easily become actors or sponsors of the project a trust relationship is built thus facilitating the implementation of related actions design thinking for innovation reflexion avril 2021 nathalie sylla annex 1 mind map shared facilities
